# My First PHP and MySQLi Project - Student Management System

This project represents my first venture into PHP and MySQLi development. Currently, I have not hosted it, but the complete source code is available on my GitHub repository.

## Description

The project is a Student Management System, which allows performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database. As a beginner in web development, I aimed to build a practical application that demonstrates my understanding of PHP and MySQLi.

The functionalities of the Student Management System include:
- **Create:** Add new student records to the database.
- **Read:** Display the list of existing student records with essential details.
- **Update:** Modify the information of students already in the database.
- **Delete:** Remove student records from the database.

I have designed the system to provide a user-friendly interface for managing student data efficiently. Through this project, I have gained valuable experience in handling database operations using PHP and MySQLi.

I am continuously working to improve and enhance this project as I advance in my web development journey. While it's not currently hosted, you can explore the complete source code on my GitHub repository.

Feel free to check out the code and provide any feedback or suggestions. Your input is highly appreciated as I continue to learn and grow as a developer.

Thank you for your interest in my first PHP and MySQLi project!
